           <b> BANDITRY ATTACK ON SCHOOL BUSES IN MARAKWET ON THE NIGHT OF 17TH FEBRUARY, 2022 CAUSING INJURIES TO 
             STUDENTS</b> <br>

On 17 th February, 2022 at about 2200hrs three (3) school buses with students from Tot Secondary School were on their
 way back to school from a field trip when they were ambushed between Arror and Tot by armed bandits.<br> <br>

The bandits indiscriminately sprayed bullets at the buses injuring fifteen (15) passengers; thirteen (13) students 
and two (2) teachers. Eight (8) of the injured students were treated and discharged and are out of danger. One (1)
 student is admitted at Chesongoch Health Centre while two (2) teachers and four (4) students were referred to Moi 
 Teaching and Referral Hospital. One of the drivers in the convoy succumbed to injuries.<br> <br>

The attack was callous, irresponsible and cowardly. Targeting innocent passengers, especially school children is 
unacceptable and the National Police Service shall continue to deploy all resources and strategies at its disposal 
to arrest all acts of criminality targeting innocent citizens. Currently a Multi-Agency Security Operation Team is 
pursuing the bandits.<br> <br>

This unfortunate attack could have been avoided if the school administration had exercised caution and complied with
 existing Ministry of Education policy on school transport beyond 1800hrs. National Police Service is therefore 
 investigating the incident with a view of holding the school administration responsible for their complicity in the
  attack.<br> <br>

In the same light, the Inspector General directs all police commands within the country to fully enforce the 
Ministry of Education policy on the school transport during night time. Those flouting the rules shall be arrested 
and prosecuted accordingly.<br> <Br>

The National Police Service condoles with the family of the deceased and wishes quick recovery to the injured.<br><br>
